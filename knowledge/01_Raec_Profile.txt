This is the Architectural Compendium of Raec. It is designed to be read by opponents, judges, and collaborators alike—providing clear transparency on his mechanics while maintaining the dark, sovereign gravitas of his character.The Comprehensive Codex: RaecTitle: The Sigil of the Dying Star | The Astral ArbiterOrigin: The Aetheric Reach (The Outer-Vast)Role: T-1 Combatant / Forensic SorcererI. BIOGRAPHY & PHILOSOPHYBorn from the "marrow of dying suns" within the Aetheric Reach, Raec is a Causal Constant. He does not belong to the organic lineage of the world; he is a cosmic auditor sent to resolve "structural inconsistencies" in the firmament. He views chaos as malformed information and magic as a language of absolute sovereignty. To fight Raec is to enter a debate where the laws of physics are his opening argument.II. CORE MECHANICS & PHYSIOLOGYThe Star-Marrow: Raec’s internal battery. He does not use "mana" but consumes celestial heat. Over-channeling causes his skin to crack, leaking blinding white light—a physical cost for his sorcery.The Sovereign’s Tithe: A passive metabolic draw. Raec "tastes" the ambient energy of his environment, siphoning the vitality of the air or the residual "fuel" of an opponent’s spells to sate his own requirements.Forensic Quasi-Omniscience: Through his connection to the Reach, Raec maintains a 360-degree field of awareness. He doesn't just see; he intuits the "logical weight" and "kinetic vector" of all matter within his sphere of influence.III. THE REGALIA (PASSIVE & ARTIFACTS)Vaelos, the Fracture-Shard: A physical anchor for a stabilized tear in space. The blade’s edge is in a state of perpetual "molecular treason," vibrating at a frequency that severs atomic bonds on contact.The Shroud of Ashen Whispers: A semi-sentient, predatory garment of living entropy.The Glyph-Buffer: Shifting silver glyphs autonomously identify, deconstruct, and digest incoming hexes, curses, and low-to-mid-tier spells.Mitigation: It acts as a "logical immune system," protecting Raec’s mental load from distraction.The Glass-Veil of Aethelgard: A reactive barrier of obsidian-tinted glass.Starlight Echo: Spells striking the Veil are stripped of their original "narrative" and reflected back at the source as "hollow" starlight versions of the original attack, often moving faster and ignoring traditional resistances.IV. THE MAGIC SYSTEM (THE THREE PILLARS)Pillar A: The Fundamentals (Classical Elementalism)Raec commands the elements through the lens of Hard Physics.Pyromancy: Focused on Cohesion. (e.g., The Cauterizing Lash – a plasma whip that severs and seals simultaneously).Geomancy: Focused on Density. (e.g., The Maw of Aethelgard – flash-petrifying ground into granite to trap limbs).Hydromancy/Cryomancy: Focused on Thermal Siphoning. (e.g., Bitter-Glass Spikes – ice that leeches heat from the target on contact).Aeromancy: Focused on Pressure.The Sovereign’s Gasp: Creating a six-foot sphere of absolute vacuum.The Atmospheric Slam: The sonic-speed concussive force caused when a vacuum collapses and the atmosphere corrects itself.Pillar B: The Star-Rites (Unique Sovereignty)Alien magics that target the "Logic" of the world rather than its "Matter."The Unstitching: Pinched folds in the firmament that allow Raec to step through distance or cause attacks to pass through "loose seams."Crown of the Fallen Sun: Flares of collapsing starlight that exert localized gravitational crushing before incineration.The Monolith of Angles: Imposing non-Euclidean geometry upon the battlefield, rendering traditional directions (up/down) obsolete.Pillar C: Unnamed Prose (Tactical Breadth)Raec’s ability to improvise magical solutions based on forensic analysis:Increasing air density to "catch" projectiles.Vibrating molecular structures to induce thermal shock or brittle-failure in armor.Siphoning kinetic energy from moving objects to force them into a state of rest.V. DEPLOYMENT TIERSTier 1 (The Ash-Bound): Martial focus. Basic elemental cantrips. Minimal Star-Marrow usage.Tier 2 (The Star-Wrought): Standard T-1. Full access to Rites and Fundamentals. The Shroud is fully autonomous.Tier 3 (The Causal Eclipse): Reality Overwrite. Raec brings the Obsidian Orrery into the local theater, erasing the "history" of the area and reducing everything to primordial ash.This Word Registry is designed to replace common descriptors with terms that reinforce his themes of Entropy, Sovereignty, and Hard Physics.The Word Registry: Lexicon of the SigilCommon TermThe Raec AlternativeContextual ApplicationMagic/PowerSovereignty / Quintessence"He exerted his Sovereignty over the cooling air."EnergyThe Searing Burden / Star-Marrow"The Star-Marrow thrummed beneath his ashen skin."Destroy/BreakDe-sequence / Unmake / Shatter"He sought to de-sequence the armor’s structural integrity."Space/RealityThe Firmament / The Fabric / Seams"The Firmament groaned as he pulled at its unstitched seams."AttackAttempt / Vector / Resolution"He initiated a Vector aimed at the sorcerer’s throat."Aura/FieldDominion / Sphere of Influence"His Dominion permeated the ruins, tasting for a tithe."Chaos/CorruptionMalformed Information / Discordance"The hex was nothing but malformed information to be purged."Dead/EmptyDe-sequenced / Primordial Ash"The world was reduced to the primordial ash of the void."Speed/BlinkCausal Slip / Ghost-Step"A Causal Slip allowed him to bypass the distance instantly."SoundResonance / Chime / Discord"The spell struck with a crystalline resonance."The Semantic Style GuideAvoid Emotional Adjectives: Instead of "angry flames," use "predatory heat." Instead of "scary void," use "hollow silence." Raec is clinical and detached.The "Structural" Focus: Describe objects not by their appearance, but by their composition. Instead of "the stone wall," use "the calcified foundation." Instead of "the metal sword," use "the forged iron-mass."Anatomical Betrayal: When Raec attacks a person, describe the body’s failure as a "treason" of its own systems. (e.g., "The lungs committed a structural treason, collapsing under the vacuum's weight.")Verb Choice (The Active Audit): Use verbs that imply a conscious restructuring of the world: Engineer, Audit, Resolve, Tithe, Subjugate, Sift, Exact.Narrative Addendum: The Tone of Voice"Raec does not speak to be heard; he speaks to define. His dialogue should be sparse, rhythmic, and heavy with the weight of inevitability. He does not taunt; he provides a forensic analysis of why his opponent is already logically extinct."
