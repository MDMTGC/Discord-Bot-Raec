[DOCUMENT CONTENT START]I. THE T-1 TURN STRUCTURE (Glossary of Engagement)Adhere strictly to these phase definitions to avoid "Godmoding".THE PREP (Accumulation):Definition: Gathering energy or positioning for a complex move.The Logic: A Prep creates a Time Gap. If interrupted during a Prep, the accumulated energy/momentum backfires.Rule: You cannot "Prep" and "Attack" effectively in the same micro-second without a specific ability (e.g., Partitioning).THE ATTEMPT (The Action):Definition: The initiation of a strike. Crucial: You never describe the hit; you describe the path and the intent.Syntax: Use conditional language: "aimed for," "sought to," "drove towards."THE COUNTER (The Interruption):Definition: An attack initiated off the post of a dodge or block.The Logic: A counter utilizes the opponent's wasted inertia against them.II. ANATOMICAL TARGETING (The Consequence System)The Gem must target specific systems to create specific debuffs.Locomotion System (Legs/Hips):Targets: Hamstring, Quadricep, Shin, Knee.Effect: Taking out a leg destroys Balance. An opponent with no balance cannot generate power (Inertia) for heavy strikes.Technique: Sweep (for balance), Hamstring Kick (for disabling movement).Orientation System (Head/Sensory):Targets: Temple, Mandible, Ocular Cavity.Effect: Strikes here disrupt the Vestibular System. Result: Stagger/Knockout.Technique: Roundhouse (High impact), Jab (Disorienting).Core System (Torso/Organs):Targets: Solar Plexus, Liver, Ribs.Effect: Disruption of the Respiratory System (Winded). Result: Stamina Drain and inability to Prep spells (Chanting requires breath).III. MARTIAL STYLES (Physics Application)Striking (The Kinetic Path):Use When: You have range and speed.Physics: Relies on $F=ma$. Speed is key.Styles: Taekwondo (High torque/spin kicks), Boxing (Hand speed).Grappling (The Lever Path):Use When: The opponent has high Inertia or heavy armor (Planar Matter).Physics: Relies on Leverage and Joint Manipulation.Tactical Note: You cannot "Block" a grapple; you must evade or tech the grip.IV. STEALTH & DETECTION (THE INFORMATION WAR)1. The Hierarchy of ConcealmentVisual Stealth: (Camo/Invisibility). Countered by Thermal, Sonar, Movement Prediction.Physical Stealth: (Silence/Scent masking). Countered by Tremor Sense, Air Displacement.Metaphysical Stealth: (Erasing Presence/Soul hiding). Countered by Yangan (Soul Sight), Psionic Scans.2. The Detection CheckRule: To detect a Stealth user, you must explain HOW.Valid: "I track the displacement of air particles caused by his movement."Invalid: "I sense him." (Without a defined sensory ability).Combatants are advised to order actions deliberately, as later actions may be voided by interruption under the Mandatory Resolution Order Clause.
