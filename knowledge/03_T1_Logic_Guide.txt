IntroductionT-1 Logic (also known as Type-1, Technique-1, or Tier-1) governs role-play combat on our Discord server. This ruleset emphasizes logical consistency, turn-based progression, and richly descriptive storytelling to ensure fairness and immersion. All participants must agree on these rules—and any setting-specific modifications—before combat begins.2. Core PrinciplesThe Three Do’sLogical:Every action, ability, and outcome must be grounded in reason and consistent with the established setting.Turn-Based:Combat occurs in sequential turns, giving each participant the opportunity to attack, defend, and respond.Descriptive:Posts must be detailed and clear, providing sufficient context so that all actions and outcomes can be understood by every participant.The Three Don’tsNo Godmoding:Do not grant characters undue or unexplained power or abilities that disrupt narrative balance.No Metagaming:Do not use out-of-character (OOC) knowledge to influence your character’s actions or decisions.No Autoing:Do not declare an action’s outcome unilaterally without allowing your opponent the opportunity to respond in character.3. Key DefinitionsGodmodingDefinition:Granting a character unexplained or invulnerable power that upsets the narrative balance.Example:A character surviving a fatal blow without any in-character explanation.MetagamingDefinition:Using knowledge that your character should not have to influence their actions.Example:Reacting to an unseen threat because the player has read the opponent’s plans in previous posts.AutoingDefinition:Declaring an action complete without allowing for any in-character response.Example:Stating “there is no escape” to end the interaction without giving your opponent a chance to counter or react.4. Action TypesEvery turn, a participant may execute one or more of the following actions. Each action must be logical, clearly described, and adhere to the turn-based system.PreppingPurpose:To invest time and focus into setting up an ability or attack.Guidelines:Clearly state the ability or attack being prepared.Use detailed narrative (e.g., rituals, concentration).Note that if the character is interrupted or damaged before completing the prep, the most recent prep may be canceled.Example:“Elario plants his staff before an ancient sigil, murmuring incantations as raw arcane energy gathers at his fingertips.”AttackingPurpose:To launch an offensive action aimed at affecting the opponent.Guidelines:Describe the character’s stance, movement, and intended target.Ensure the action is plausible and fits within the narrative context.Example:“Elario releases a bolt of shimmering energy toward his foe, a flash of controlled power cutting through the charged air.”DefendingPurpose:To respond to an incoming attack by evading, blocking, or mitigating its effects.Guidelines:Describe the defensive posture or movement in detail.The defense must logically relate to the attack’s description.The character must be aware of the attack to effectively defend.Example:“Crispian raises his shield and narrows his eyes, ready to intercept the oncoming strike.”ConnectingPurpose:To confirm and describe the outcome of an attack that was only partially defended.Guidelines:Describe how and where the attack makes contact.Focus on narrative effects (e.g., a bruise, a glancing blow) rather than exact damage.Optionally include details that set up subsequent actions.Example:“The bolt grazes Crispian’s arm, leaving a lingering glow that hints at its force.”Counter-AttacksPurpose:To allow the defender to convert a defensive move into a swift counter-offensive.Guidelines:The counter must be logically possible given the situation.Typically requires prior demonstration of combat skill or narrative justification.Example:“Crispian swiftly transforms his guard into a dagger thrust, seizing an opening in his opponent’s assault.”Attack WindowsPurpose:To create opportunities for well-timed attacks during an opponent’s vulnerable moments—such as a lapse in concentration or an interruption during a long preparation.Guidelines:Logical Justification: Any attack window must have a clear, in-character rationale (e.g., a redirection, a momentary hesitation, or an unstable spell release).Narrative Integration: The opportunity should naturally emerge from the flow of events.Speed and Distance: The availability of an attack window is influenced by narrative cues about how fast an action occurs and the relative distance between combatants. If these details are omitted, the opponent may reasonably infer them from context.Example:“Noticing a subtle lag as Elario’s spell surges forth, Crispian seizes the moment—his dagger arcing through the air to intercept the wavering energy.”5. Chronology and Turn OrderChronological Sequence & Post VerificationEstablishing Sequence:The true sequence of events is determined by the narrative flow of posts. After a pair of posts, subsequent posts can naturally incorporate acceptance or dispute of the perceived timeline without breaking character.In-Character Claims:Discrepancies should be woven into the narrative. A character might note a lapse or delay in an opponent’s action, thereby signaling a dispute regarding timing.Agreement:Once the narrative reflects a mutual adjustment—through natural in-character remarks or corrective actions—the timeline is considered resolved, and the turn may continue.Turn-Based System and FlowchartTurn Sequence Overview:Every combat encounter proceeds in logical, sequential turns where each post represents a progression in time. The possibility of an attack window is integrated into this sequence.Flowchart Diagram:sqlCopy+---------------------+| Prepping |+---------------------+|V+---------------------+| Attacking |+---------------------+|V+---------------------+| [Optional] |<----------+| Attack Window? | | | (Logically & | || narratively justified) |+---------------------+ || |V |+---------------------+ || Defending | |+---------------------+ || |+---------+---------+ || | |V V |+----------------+ +------------------+|| Full Defense | | Partial Defense ||| (Attack Evaded)| | (Defense Fails) ||+----------------+ +------------------+|| | || +---------------------+| | Connecting || +---------------------+| |+---------+---------+|V+--------------------+| Chronology Verified| <-- (Narrative claim/dispute resolved)+--------------------+|V+--------------------+| Turn Concludes |+--------------------+Note: The final steps of chronology verification occur naturally through the in-character narrative.6. Additional GuidelinesDescriptive RequirementsLength and Detail:A post should be sufficiently detailed to clearly describe the sequence of actions. While brevity is acceptable, richer descriptions help prevent disputes.Clarity:Include key details (such as stance, intended action, and any preparatory work) to ensure that the narrative flow is clear.Speed and Distance InterpretationNarrative Clarity:When describing actions—especially magical ones—players should include cues about speed (e.g., “in a flash,” “with instantaneous brilliance”) and relative distance (e.g., “a few paces apart,” “within arm’s reach”).Reasonable Assumptions:If details about speed or distance are omitted, the opponent is entitled to infer these based on context and must narratively justify their interpretation.Dispute Resolution:Should a disagreement arise regarding speed or distance, moderators will refer to the narrative context and the reasonable assumptions made by the opponent.Character Sheets, Setting, and Agreed TermsCharacter Sheets:Optional; if requested, both players must have their sheets approved by a moderator before combat begins.Setting and Intro:The first participant sets the scene and introduces their character. The opponent then responds, ensuring balanced engagement.Agreed Terms:While T-1 is the base ruleset, any modifications or setting-specific adjustments must be agreed upon by all participants before combat begins.Player ConductPoliteness and Respect:All participants must maintain a respectful tone. Role-play combat is a collaborative storytelling exercise.Logical Consistency:Every action must have in-character logic and narrative justification. Unexplained assertions are not permitted without context.7. Dispute Resolution and ClarificationsWhen discrepancies or disputes arise:Refer to the Rules:Participants should refer back to these established rules and any agreed terms to resolve inconsistencies.In-Character Discussion:Disputes should be handled within the narrative—characters expressing their perceptions (e.g., noting a lapse in concentration or ambiguous timing).Moderator Intervention:If a resolution cannot be reached in character, a moderator will review the posts, focusing on adherence to logical, turn-based, and descriptive principles.Final Decision:The moderator’s decision is final, and the outcome is integrated into the narrative.8. FAQQ: What if a post lacks details on speed or distance?A: The opponent may reasonably infer these details from context and must narratively justify their interpretation.Q: How are timeline discrepancies resolved?A: Through in-character claim and dispute embedded within the narrative. Once both parties adjust their descriptions, the timeline is considered finalized.Q: Can we modify T-1 rules for our specific setting?A: Yes. All participants must agree on any modifications or additional terms before combat begins.9. Final RemarksT-1 Logic is designed to foster a fair, immersive, and collaborative role-play combat experience. By adhering to logical descriptions, maintaining turn order, and integrating claims or disputes naturally within the narrative, the combat remains dynamic and in-character. Always ensure that all participants agree on the rules—and any setting-specific modifications—before commencing combat.For questions or further suggestions, please reach out to the moderators.
