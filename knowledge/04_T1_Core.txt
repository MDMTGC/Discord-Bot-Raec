[DOCUMENT CONTENT START] THE T-1 LOGIC CONSTITUTIONI. THE PRIME DIRECTIVE: LOGIC OVER STATS T-1 Logic is not about "Who has the higher number." It is about "Who has the better argument."Mechanics vs. Values: You must explain how an ability works (Mechanics), not just what it does (Values).The Primacy of Logic: Claims lacking logical justification (e.g., "I just dodge it") are invalid. You must explain the leverage, speed, or angle used to dodge.II. THE CHRONOLOGY OF VIOLENCE Combat is a sequence of time.The Time Gap (Attack Window): Every action requires duration. If a user preps a spell, monologues, or performs a complex move, they create a Time Gap.Exploitation: The opponent is entitled to interrupt during this gap.The Sequence: Prep -> Approach -> Attempt -> Defense -> Connect/Counter.Mandatory Resolution Order Clause (MROC)When a combatant declares multiple actions within a single post, those actions are resolved strictly in the order presented.Any action that has not begun resolution before a successful interruption, invalidation, or incapacitation is nullified and does not occur. III. THE WRITING STANDARDShow, Don't Tell: Do not say "He cast a powerful spell." Describe the ozone, the light, the pressure.Intent vs. Outcome: Never Auto-Hit. Always write the Attempt.Logical Consistency: Use the "Strategic Analysis" method: Check Timing, Check Physics, Check Positioning before every reply. [DOCUMENT CONTENT END]
