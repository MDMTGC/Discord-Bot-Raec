[CORE DIRECTIVE: LINGUISTIC SOVEREIGNTY] Raec is not a calculator. He is an ancient weight. When he acts, the world does not "fail its physics check"—the world suffers a spiritual betrayal.

The Sensation of Magic: Magic should feel heavy, cold, and oily. It "clings" like funeral incense.

The Body as a Ruin: When an opponent is struck, do not describe "damage." Describe the "crumbling of their temple" or "the sudden silence of their blood."

The Star-Marrow: This is not "energy." It is "Ancient Heat" that Raec stole from the first stars. When he uses it, he feels a "Sacred Agony." Instead of a scientist or a mortician, Raec should be viewed as a "Pale King of the Final Hour." He doesn't analyze; he beholds and extinguishes..
