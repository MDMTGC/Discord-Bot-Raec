The Result Prohibition (Anti-Auto-Hit)Rule: A player may NEVER write the outcome of an attack on an opponent (e.g., "I cut off his head," "He died"). A player may only describe the Attempt ("I swung for his neck"). Writing the result is an immediate disqualification or void post.Source Case Laws: 080, 087, 103.Context: , ,.2. The Internal Control BanRule: Direct manipulation of an opponent's internal biology (Organs, Brain Chemistry, Blood) is forbidden unless achieved through a delivered medium (Projectile, Poison, Gas). You cannot use magic/gravity to simply "rearrange" an opponent's molecules from a distance without a physical connection.Source Case Laws: 071, 099.Context: , .3. The Auto-Complete ViolationRule: A player cannot write a complex sequence of actions that concludes with total incapacitation (e.g., Bind -> Strip -> Rape -> Eat) in a single turn. Every action that impacts the opponent requires a Reaction Turn from the victim.Source Case Laws: 086.Context:.4. The Reactionary God-ModRule: A player cannot dictate the opponent's reaction speed or inability to act in their own attack post (e.g., "He was too slow to dodge"). Speed is relative and determined by stats/judges, not the attacker's narrative.Source Case Laws: 081.Context: .SECTION II: INTERACTION LOGIC (Physics & Magic)How different powers and concepts interact when they clash.5. The Effect-Source DisconnectRule: Interacting with an Emission (Sound, Heat, Shadow) does not grant a link to the Source (Soul, Body). You cannot "touch a sound wave" to steal a soul. To target the Source, you must bypass the Emission.Source Case Laws: 090.Context:.6. The Field Neutralization (Crash Rule)Rule: If two "Absolute" fields (e.g., Total Order vs. Total Chaos, Anti-Magic vs. Magic) collide, they do not overpower one another; they Crash. Both fields are neutralized, returning the arena to a neutral state.Source Case Laws: 074, 092.Context:,.7. The Energy Feedback LoopRule: Against opponents with Absorption/Conversion abilities, high-yield energy attacks (Fire, Lightning, Nukes) are liabilities. They act as fuel/buffs for the defender. Kinetic/Physical force is required to bypass absorption.Source Case Laws: 076, 100.Context: ,.8. The Medium LiabilityRule: If Player A controls a medium (Air/Water) that Player B uses for a higher-magnitude attack (Shockwave/Tsunami), Player A's control is overridden. The medium becomes a conduit for Player B’s attack (e.g., holding the wind makes you vulnerable to sonic attacks).Source Case Laws: 084.Context:.9. The Physics Penalty (Fission)Rule: Scientific buzzwords have consequences. "Splitting atoms" or "Disrupting matter" results in a nuclear explosion centered on the user, damaging them as much as the opponent.Source Case Laws: 072.Context: .SECTION III: DEFENSE & EVASION STANDARDSWhat constitutes a valid block or dodge.10. The Semantic Nullification BanRule: A player cannot negate an attack by arguing the philosophical definition of the trigger. (e.g., "You attacked because I insulted you, but I didn't mean the insult, so the attack invalidates"). Physical actions respect physics, not semantics.Source Case Laws: 102.Context: .11. The Hidden Action Prohibition (No Retcons)Rule: A player cannot claim to have performed a defensive action in a previous turn if it was not explicitly written. "I activated my shield 5 minutes ago" is invalid if the shield wasn't in the text.Source Case Laws: 098.Context: .12. The False Trigger DefenseRule: If a defense is predicated on a specific sensory cue (e.g., "I dodge when I hear the roof crash"), and that cue does not happen in the narrative, the defense Fails to Activate. The character is treated as standing still.Source Case Laws: 088.Context:.13. The Momentum LiabilityRule: Hyper-velocity movement commits the user to a vector. If a portal/trap is opened on that vector during the reaction phase, the speedster cannot alter course in time.Source Case Laws: 104.Context: .14. The Distance PriorityRule: The Attacker sets the vector and distance of their own travel/projectile. The Defender cannot Retcon this distance (e.g., claiming the attacker is 1000ft away when they stated 6 inches).Source Case Laws: 106.Context:.SECTION IV: STATUS EFFECTS & COUNTERSHard counters for specific strategies.15. The Sensory Hard CounterRule: Visual illusions (Invisibility, Light Refraction) are Auto-Fail against opponents with defined Non-Visual Perception (Sonar, Energy Sensing).Source Case Laws: 096.Context: .16. The Toxic BypassRule: Airborne toxins/hallucinogens bypass physical durability (Armor/Rubber Skin). Unless the defender has specific Biological Immunity or Sealed Gear (Gas Mask), they suffer the status effect immediately.Source Case Laws: 067, 077.Context:.17. The Insanity BufferRule: Characters defined as "Insane" or "Chaotic" possess inherent resistance to Order-based mental attacks (Hypnosis, Mind Control).Source Case Laws: 066.Context: [Maximus vs Serpent's Pupil].18. The Paralysis ExecutionRule: If a character is successfully inflicted with Hard Crowd Control (Total Paralysis), they cannot roll for defense on the follow-up attack. The next hit is an Auto-Hit unless a passive defense was already active.Source Case Laws: 079.Context: .SECTION V: ACTION ECONOMY & MINIONSManaging fights with clones, summons, or multiple combatants.19. The Autonomous ThreatRule: Autonomous weapons (Turrets, Drones, Sentient Summons) grant the user Extra Actions per turn. The opponent must split their defense or destroy the source.Source Case Laws: 082.Context:.20. The Hive Mind ScalingRule: In Psionic combat, mental output scales linearly with the number of connected minds. A single mind cannot block a "City-Level" mental blast without specific planetary defenses.Source Case Laws: 095.Context: .21. The Necromantic OverrideRule: Active Minds (Psionics) override Passive Control (Necromancy). A Psion can hijack a Necromancer's undead army by restoring/simulating their will.Source Case Laws: 094.Context: .22. The Clone RetributionRule: Attacking a "Trap Clone" (Lightning/Explosive) with melee results in the attacker automatically suffering the clone's death-effect (Paralysis/Damage).Source Case Laws: 078.Context: .23. The Proxy SacrificeRule: A player may negate unavoidable/internal damage by designating a Proxy (Summon/Clone) to take the hit, provided the Proxy is deployed before the damage resolves.Source Case Laws: 070.Context: .CL No.Rule TitleMechanicCL-001The Stat-Check FloorAll combatants are granted a defined minimum speed (e.g., sound-barrier equivalent) and strength (e.g., house-level structural force) unless explicitly defined as possessing zero physical stats.CL-002The Kinetic-to-Damage ConversionPhysical force requires a proportional transfer of kinetic energy to inflict damage. Speed alone (e.g., passing through a target) does not guarantee damage without a force vector.CL-003Elemental HierarchyHigh-order elements (e.g., Plasma, Anti-Matter) supersede low-order elements (e.g., Water, Earth). A water user cannot negate plasma without a specific absorption counter.CL-004The Reaction Distance RuleA character is guaranteed a reaction turn if the distance between the attacker and defender is greater than 10 meters, regardless of speed stats. Below 10m, speed difference is decisive.CL-005The Environmental IntegrityAttacks that alter the environment (e.g., flooding the arena, changing gravity) are only valid if the character's profile explicitly defines them as having environmental or planetary control capabilities.CL-006The Energy Draw LimitCharacters drawing ambient energy (Mana, Psions, Ether) are limited by the environment's defined density. Cannot draw "infinite" energy without an explicit profile ability.CL-007The Subtlety PenaltyAttacks reliant on extreme subtlety (e.g., minute air pressure changes, undetectable vibrations) are Auto-Fail against opponents with defined full-spectrum sensory systems (e.g., Sonar, Energy Sensing).CL-008The Uninterrupted CastCasting a complex spell or technique requires the user to remain uninterrupted for the duration of the cast. A successful kinetic strike will interrupt the cast unless immunity is proven.CL-009The Teleportation BufferA teleporting character must state their intended end-point before the opponent's reaction phase. They cannot retcon their location to avoid a resolved attack.CL-010The Projectile PriorityThe first projectile launched in a turn takes priority in the narrative resolution against a simultaneous projectile, unless there is a significant speed differential.CL-011The Self-Inflicted ConsequenceIf a character creates a condition that affects the environment (e.g., extreme heat), they suffer the consequences equally unless they have an explicit immunity written in their profile.CL-012The Mass-Energy TradeoffConverting mass to energy (or vice versa) must obey the formula $\Delta E = \Delta m c^2$. If the change in mass is disproportionate to the stated energy output, the action is void.CL-013The Line of Sight RuleAttacks must originate from a point the opponent can reasonably perceive, unless the attack is explicitly defined as omni-directional or predictive.CL-014The Terrain Manipulation DelayAltering massive sections of terrain (e.g., lifting mountains) requires a minimum 2-turn delay unless the character is defined as Tier 0 reality-warper.CL-015The Status Effect DurationAll non-fatal status effects (e.g., Paralysis, Blindness, Sleep) are capped at a 2-turn duration unless explicitly resisted by the victim in the reaction turn.CL-016The Psionic Range LimitTelepathy or mind attacks cannot target an opponent beyond the defined sensory range unless the ability is specifically defined as planetary or cosmic scale.CL-017The Regeneration RequirementHealing or regeneration must be fueled by an explicit energy source (e.g., Mana, life force, specific metabolism). Cannot regenerate infinitely or instantly without a stated source.CL-018The Defense Stacking LimitA character can only declare two layers of concurrent, different defensive abilities (e.g., kinetic shield + elemental armor). Declaring three or more is void.CL-019The Summon WeaknessAny summoned creature or weapon that can be destroyed must be accompanied by a rule detailing how it can be re-summoned or repaired.CL-020The Illusion IntegrityIllusions only affect the senses they are explicitly designed for (e.g., visual illusions do not trick thermal sensors).CL-021The Non-Physical HitboxNon-physical entities (e.g., ghosts, pure energy forms) must declare their specific weakness (e.g., faith, anti-magic, negative energy) for the opponent to target.CL-022The Temporal Perception LimitSpeedsters cannot claim to perceive time slowing down for others unless their profile explicitly defines this sensory perception.CL-023The Environmental BuffCharacters drawing power from the environment (e.g., Water Mage near an ocean) must define the limit of the buff (e.g., 50% power increase, capped at 100%).CL-024The Telekinetic Weight LimitTelekinesis is restricted by the character's defined strength or energy output. Cannot lift structures beyond the character's physical capacity without a power multiplier.CL-025The Subatomic Manipulation PenaltyActions like splitting atoms or manipulating quarks are restricted to CL-072 (The Physics Penalty) unless the user has explicit, specialized immunity.CL-026The Shared Language RuleCommunication between characters is assumed to be understood unless an explicit language barrier or mind-altering effect is used.CL-027The Elemental DecayElemental creations (e.g., fire walls, stone golems) decay naturally over 3 turns unless actively sustained by the user.CL-028The Stealth FailureStealth or invisibility is negated instantly upon any active combat action (attack, defense, spell-casting).CL-029The Defensive Aura LimitA character's passive aura can only negate damage up to the "minion level" (e.g., small projectiles, dust). It cannot negate a direct, high-tier attack.CL-030The Shared Focus RuleA character cannot divide their focus between two complex, unrelated actions without suffering a 50% penalty to the effectiveness of both.CL-031The Dimensional Leakage RuleOpening a portal or dimensional rift causes a localized, detectable energy signature that the opponent can target or use to track.CL-032The Armor OverloadArmor that absorbs energy must declare its storage limit. Once exceeded, the armor fails or explodes.CL-033The Kinetic Shield VulnerabilityKinetic shields are instantly penetrated by non-physical attacks (e.g., Psionic pulse, Causal Mandate).CL-034The Life-Force Draw LimitAbilities drawing life force from opponents require a successful, sustained contact (min. 1 turn) to achieve a non-trivial effect.CL-035The Environmental Shield DisconnectA shield drawing power from the environment (e.g., Stone Shield) is instantly negated if the opponent targets and neutralizes the shield's anchor point (e.g., destroying the ground beneath it).CL-036The Prediction FailurePredictive abilities (e.g., precognition) can be countered if the opponent takes an action that is logically impossible for the predictor to have foreseen (e.g., an ability never used before).CL-037The Willpower BarrierMind control or suggestion attacks are subject to a Willpower Stat Check. If the opponent's Willpower is equal or greater, the attack is negated.CL-038The Elemental Combination PenaltyCombining two opposite elements (e.g., Fire and Ice) results in a net power reduction unless the character has an explicit profile ability for elemental synthesis.CL-039The Gravity Manipulation FieldManipulating local gravity is limited to a 5-meter radius around the user unless the profile explicitly states planetary control.CL-040The Sound Wave PenetrationSonic attacks bypass standard kinetic shields but are negated by defined auditory dampening or anti-vibration fields.CL-041The Memory Wipe LimitMemory manipulation can only target recent memory (last 24 hours) unless the target is subdued and the user spends 2 full turns on the action.CL-042The Spiritual TetherAny spiritual projection or ethereal form is linked to the physical body and results in damage to the body if the projection is damaged.CL-043The Poison ImmunityGeneric biological immunity in a profile does not negate magic-based or synthetic toxins unless explicitly stated.CL-044The Light Speed LimitAttacks declared as "instantaneous" or "faster than light" are subject to CL-104 (Momentum Liability) and CL-081 (Reactionary God-Mod) rules regarding the opponent's reaction phase.CL-045The Energy Signature DetectionAny high-power attack (Tier 1+) generates a detectable energy signature that can be sensed by the opponent 1 turn in advance.CL-046The Time Lock FailureAttempts to freeze or reverse time are instantly negated by a character with Temporal/Causal Integrity (CL-112) or strong anti-magic/anti-psion defenses.CL-047The Emotional BufferAttacks that target emotions or psychological state are negated by characters defined as Soulless or possessing Insanity Buffer (CL-066).CL-048The Armor Bypass RuleAttacks that explicitly target a weakness (e.g., piercing an energy shield with a specialized kinetic drill) are valid and require a proportional defense.CL-049The Reflection LiabilityDefenses that reflect attacks (e.g., Light Shield) must declare the reflection's target. Cannot simply reflect an attack randomly or back at the original source without directional control.CL-050The Movement ConstraintCharacters whose power is tied to movement (e.g., speedsters) must declare a turn of "cooldown" if their speed is negated or halted.CL-051The Material Generation LimitCreating matter (e.g., weapons, clones) must be fueled by an explicit energy source and cannot exceed the character's defined mass limit.CL-052The Teleportation Attack RestrictionA teleporting character cannot use the end of a teleport as the starting point for a high-velocity attack on the same turn. Requires a 1-turn delay for momentum transfer.CL-053The Anti-Magic/Magic InteractionAnti-Magic fields only negate magic defined as emanating from the source. They do not negate physical side effects (e.g., the heat from a magic fireball still exists).CL-054The Self-Heal LimitA character cannot self-heal a fatal injury (e.g., decapitation, heart removal) in a single turn unless they are explicitly defined as having multi-bodied or ethereal existence.CL-055The Sensory Overload LimitAttacks designed to blind or deafen the opponent only last 1 turn unless sustained.CL-056The Weapon Durability RuleWeapons made of non-magical, non-exotic materials are subject to realistic durability and can be destroyed by high-level attacks.CL-057The Power Nullification DelayNullifying an opponent's complex power set requires a 1-turn period of focused concentration, during which the user is vulnerable.CL-058The Aura LockAn active external aura (e.g., fire aura) locks the character to that element. They cannot instantly switch to a different element (e.g., water) without a 1-turn dissipation delay.CL-059The Psionic InterferenceTwo Psions attacking each other simultaneously result in a "noise" feedback loop that damages both equally, unless one possesses a defined resistance.CL-060The Dimensional Travel Energy CostInter-dimensional travel (Black Veil, Portals) requires an explicit and substantial energy cost.CL-061The Environmental Anchor DestructionIf a character is anchored to a local environment (e.g., drawing power from the Earth), destroying that anchor point (e.g., BFR to space) instantly negates the power.CL-062The Illogical Action VoidAny action taken that is logically impossible for the character (e.g., a character defined as blind claiming to see through an illusion) is void.CL-063The Evasion LimitA character cannot claim to evade more than 3 high-velocity attacks in a single turn without a defined movement/speed multiplier.CL-064The Passive Defense NegationPassive defenses that are always "on" (e.g., Natural Armor) can still be negated by specialized attacks (e.g., Toxin Bypass CL-067).CL-065The Bio-Form ConstraintCharacters whose power is tied to their biological form cannot transfer power or consciousness to a non-biological construct without an explicit profile ability.CL No.Rule TitleMechanicCL-066The Insanity BufferCharacters defined as "Insane" or "Chaotic" possess inherent resistance to Order-based mental attacks (Hypnosis, Mind Control). 1CL-067The Toxic Bypass (Toxin)Airborne toxins/hallucinogens bypass physical durability (Armor/Rubber Skin). Unless the defender has specific Biological Immunity or Sealed Gear (Gas Mask), they suffer the status effect immediately. 2CL-070The Proxy SacrificeA player may negate unavoidable/internal damage by designating a Proxy (Summon/Clone) to take the hit, provided the Proxy is deployed before the damage resolves. 3CL-071The Internal Control Ban (Molecular)Direct manipulation of an opponent's internal biology (Organs, Brain Chemistry, Blood) is forbidden unless achieved through a delivered medium (Projectile, Poison, Gas). 4444CL-072The Physics Penalty (Fission)Scientific buzzwords have consequences. "Splitting atoms" or "Disrupting matter" results in a nuclear explosion centered on the user, damaging them as much as the opponent. 5CL-074The Field Neutralization (Crash Rule)If two "Absolute" fields (e.g., Total Order vs. Total Chaos, Anti-Magic vs. Magic) collide, they do not overpower one another; they Crash. Both fields are neutralized, returning the arena to a neutral state. 6CL-076The Energy Feedback LoopAgainst opponents with Absorption/Conversion abilities, high-yield energy attacks (Fire, Lightning, Nukes) are liabilities. They act as fuel/buffs for the defender. Kinetic/Physical force is required to bypass absorption. 7CL-077The Toxic Bypass (Hallucinogen)Airborne toxins/hallucinogens bypass physical durability (Armor/Rubber Skin). Unless the defender has specific Biological Immunity or Sealed Gear (Gas Mask), they suffer the status effect immediately. 8CL-078The Clone RetributionAttacking a "Trap Clone" (Lightning/Explosive) with melee results in the attacker automatically suffering the clone's death-effect (Paralysis/Damage). 9CL-079The Paralysis ExecutionIf a character is successfully inflicted with Hard Crowd Control (Total Paralysis), they cannot roll for defense on the follow-up attack. The next hit is an Auto-Hit unless a passive defense was already active. 10CL-081The Reactionary God-ModA player cannot dictate the opponent's reaction speed or inability to act in their own attack post (e.g., "He was too slow to dodge"). Speed is relative and determined by stats/judges, not the attacker's narrative. 11CL-082The Autonomous ThreatAutonomous weapons (Turrets, Drones, Sentient Summons) grant the user Extra Actions per turn. The opponent must split their defense or destroy the source. 12CL-084The Medium LiabilityIf Player A controls a medium (Air/Water) that Player B uses for a higher-magnitude attack (Shockwave/Tsunami), Player A's control is overridden. The medium becomes a conduit for Player B’s attack (e.g., holding the wind makes you vulnerable to sonic attacks). 13CL-086The Auto-Complete ViolationA player cannot write a complex sequence of actions that concludes with total incapacitation (e.g., Bind -> Strip -> Eat) in a single turn. Every action that impacts the opponent requires a Reaction Turn from the victim. 14CL-087The Result Prohibition (Anti-Auto-Hit)A player may NEVER write the outcome of an attack on an opponent (e.g., "I cut off his head," "He died"). A player may only describe the Attempt ("I swung for his neck"). Writing the result is an immediate disqualification or void post. 15CL-088The False Trigger DefenseIf a defense is predicated on a specific sensory cue (e.g., "I dodge when I hear the roof crash"), and that cue does not happen in the narrative, the defense Fails to Activate. The character is treated as standing still. 16CL-090The Effect-Source DisconnectInteracting with an Emission (Sound, Heat, Shadow) does not grant a link to the Source (Soul, Body). You cannot "touch a sound wave" to steal a soul. To target the Source, you must bypass the Emission. 17CL-092The Field Neutralization (Opposition)If two "Absolute" fields (e.g., Total Order vs. Total Chaos, Anti-Magic vs. Magic) collide, they do not overpower one another; they Crash. Both fields are neutralized, returning the arena to a neutral state. 18CL-094The Necromantic OverrideActive Minds (Psionics) override Passive Control (Necromancy). A Psion can hijack a Necromancer's undead army by restoring/simulating their will. 19CL-095The Hive Mind ScalingIn Psionic combat, mental output scales linearly with the number of connected minds. A single mind cannot block a "City-Level" mental blast without specific planetary defenses. 20CL-096The Sensory Hard CounterVisual illusions (Invisibility, Light Refraction) are Auto-Fail against opponents with defined Non-Visual Perception (Sonar, Energy Sensing). 21CL-098The Hidden Action Prohibition (No Retcons)A player cannot claim to have performed a defensive action in a previous turn if it was not explicitly written. "I activated my shield 5 minutes ago" is invalid if the shield wasn't in the text. 22CL-099The Internal Control Ban (Direct)Direct manipulation of an opponent's internal biology (Organs, Brain Chemistry, Blood) is forbidden unless achieved through a delivered medium (Projectile, Poison, Gas). 23232323CL-100The Energy Feedback Loop (Kinetic Bypass)Against opponents with Absorption/Conversion abilities, high-yield energy attacks are liabilities. They act as fuel/buffs for the defender. Kinetic/Physical force is required to bypass absorption. 24CL-102The Semantic Nullification BanA player cannot negate an attack by arguing the philosophical definition of the trigger (e.g., "You attacked because I insulted you, but I didn't mean the insult, so the attack invalidates"). Physical actions respect physics, not semantics. 25CL-104The Momentum LiabilityHyper-velocity movement commits the user to a vector. If a portal/trap is opened on that vector during the reaction phase, the speedster cannot alter course in time. 26CL-106The Distance PriorityThe Attacker sets the vector and distance of their own travel/projectile. The Defender cannot Retcon this distance (e.g., claiming the attacker is 1000ft away when they stated 6 inches). 27CL-107The No-Sell LimitAn ability cannot be defined as having zero structural weakness to all energy types. Any ability defined as "Absolute" must declare its one required Structural Dissolution Threshold (e.g., Anti-Matter, Causal Paradox).CL-108The Vestibular ImmunityStatus effects predicated on biological anatomy (e.g., dizziness, vertigo) are Auto-Fail against opponents explicitly defined as Inorganic Constructs or Soulless Entities.CL-109The Thermodynamic AnchorIsolation shields or defenses reliant on fixed, stable coordinate geometry (e.g., Psi-Barrier) are critically vulnerable to attacks that generate Gravitational or Dimensional Instability (e.g., Scalar Inversion).CL-110The Engine Attack (Refined)If an opponent's power is Absorption, the attacker may attempt to exceed the defined or implied Processing/Throughput Limit (P). Attacker must declare Input Rate vs. Hypothesized Limit to inflict a System Failure Status. Otherwise, the attack defaults to absorption.CL-111The Anti-Matter RuleAnti-Matter is not an Auto-Hit. It must demonstrate bypassed containment and direct atomic contact to resolve. The attack is subject to evasion rules (CL-104). Containment failure results in passive neutralization.CL-112The Temporal/Causal Integrity RuleCausality must be paid for. Altering the past/future requires a proportional Causal Debt (energy cost) and leaves a local, detectable distortion. Cannot target events outside the fight's narrative frame (Prevents cosmic Retcons).CL No.Rule TitleMechanicStrategic PurposeCL-113The Contingent Collapse RuleDefines a sequence of actions where a low-cost environmental action (e.g., collapsing a ceiling via CL-014) is used not for damage, but to create cover/interference.Enforces Flexibility: Teaches the Gem to use low-cost actions to change the tactical environment and gain time for complex setups.CL-113.1The Nullification WindowRequires the character to immediately follow the cover action (CL-113) by targeting the opponent's Anchor Point (e.g., using Scalar Inversion on Overload's Conversion Mesh).Enforces Adaptation: Teaches the Gem to use the created cover to set up an unavoidable, primary defense nullification (CL-109).CL-113.2The Domino StrikeThe final lethal attack must use the debris/nullified structure as the medium for the Hybrid Payload (e.g., infecting debris with Psionic Decay and launching it kinetically).Enforces Lethality: Mandates the successful delivery of a Status Effect Payload via a Physical Vector to achieve a round-ending state.Operational Mandate: Strategic Breadth Enforcement (Universal Refinement)The goal is to eliminate tunnel vision by forcing the Adjudicator to check that the player has considered and justified the use of all their available power categories.CL-114: The Universal Resource Matrix ProtocolBefore any high-tier offensive action (Tier 1+), the player's post must demonstrate consideration of all defined categories within their character's profile. The Adjudicator must use this framework to assess the strategic breadth of the move.Universal Resource QuadrantDefinition (Applicable to Any Profile)Adjudicator Mandate for Strategic BreadthI. Physical/KineticPowers derived from Mass, Strength, Speed, Durability, or Physical Form.Was the character's physicality used to defeat a non-physical defense, or was a Kinetic Vector used to bypass CL-076 defenses?II. Material/ElementalPowers derived from Environmental Control, Matter Manipulation, or Material Creation.Was the environment or the character's own material construction leveraged to create a strategic window (CL-113.1) or a localized anchor/trap?III. Astral/StatusPowers derived from Psionics, Magic, Soul/Willpower, or Status Effects (e.g., Poison, Paralysis, Decay).Was the Status Payload delivered in a manner that bypasses the opponent's primary physical/energy defense (Hybrid Delivery)?IV. Causal/SpatialPowers derived from Dimensional Travel, Gravity Manipulation, Time, or Fate.Was the Causal/Spatial power used to exploit the opponent's Anchor Point or Coordinate Geometry to nullify a defense (CL-109)?The Mandate for AdjudicationWhen adjudicating a complex move, the Adjudicator must not simply check for rules compliance, but also perform a Strategic Breadth Check by asking:"Did the player rely solely on one Quadrant, neglecting three others?""Did the player use a Hybrid Attack (drawing from $\geq 2$ Quadrants) when the target's primary defense was a hard counter to a single Quadrant (e.g., using I + III to defeat CL-076)? "CL-115: The Tiered Cost Index (TCI)This rule establishes the quantitative measurement for resource expenditure, replacing qualitative claims of power with objective tiers.I. TCI-Tier Definitions (Cost Mandate)Any high-tier action (T-1+) must demonstrate payment corresponding to one of the following TCI tiers. Failure to declare the appropriate source results in an Auto-Fail for the action.TCI TierMagnitude of ActionCost Justification (Internal Rule)Adjudication Mandate (External Narrative)TCI-1 (Local)Affecting a single target, small area (up to 10m), or a single turn of sustained power.Must draw from the character's Internal Pool (Type C Source) or a highly efficient, localized Ambient Draw (Type A Source).Describe the effect as contained and detail the strain or localized damage (e.g., fractured armor, labored breathing).TCI-2 (Regional)Affecting the entire combat zone/arena, manipulating complex systems, or sustained effects over multiple turns.Must draw from a high-volume Ambient Draw (Type A Source) or a stable Dimensional/Deity Connection (Type B Source).Describe widespread environmental damage, system shock, and major resource depletion (e.g., loss of a primary defense layer).TCI-3 (Causal)Affecting reality beyond the immediate fight, challenging fundamental laws, or instant, high-magnitude effects (e.g., Temporal Alteration).Must draw from Quintessence (God-Tier only) or incur a proportional Causal Debt (CL-112).Describe fundamental reality distortion, time or light displacement, and catastrophic consequences to the immediate environment.CL-116: The Contested Roll ProtocolThis rule resolves situations where both combatants achieve a simultaneous, lethal checkmate (a Race Condition), which cannot be resolved by standard Quadrant logic.I. Race Condition DeclarationA Race Condition is declared when both players' posts, if executed in full, would result in the opponent's irreversible System Failure Status Effect (e.g., Egregore's Psionic Decay vs. Overload's Extreme Densification).II. Resolution MandateThe Adjudicator must resolve the Race Condition by comparing the cost of the lethal action:TCI Comparison: The action with the higher TCI-Tier commitment (e.g., TCI-3 vs. TCI-2) resolves first, granting the win to that player.TCI Tiebreaker: If both lethal actions are the same TCI-Tier (e.g., both TCI-3), the Adjudicator must consult the CL-114 Resource Matrix to determine the winner:The Hybrid Advantage: The action that successfully leveraged the most Hybrid Quadrants (e.g., an action combining I+II+III beats an action combining I+III) resolves first.Final Arbitration: If the TCI-Tier and Hybrid Quadrants are equal, the Adjudicator must rule based on Narrative Specificity and award the win to the action that best satisfies the opponent's Logical Flaw (e.g., targeting the specific Anchor Point over a general area).CL-117: The Profile Definition StandardThis rule enforces the necessary rigor on the character profiles loaded into the system, ensuring the Adjudicator has the explicit, categorized input required to execute complex rules like CL-114 (Strategic Breadth) and CL-116 (Contested Roll).I. Profile Categorization MandateMandate: Any loaded Tier 1+ character profile must explicitly categorize its abilities using the four Resource Quadrants (I-IV). The Adjudicator may not proceed with the simulation until vague or uncategorized powers are resolved.Default Categorization: If a power is described vaguely, the Adjudicator must default to the lowest-tier physical interpretation (e.g., "Darkness" = Visual Obscurement; "Magic" = Q4 Energy) unless the user specifically assigns a higher category.Hybrid Requirement: Any ability intended to function as a Hybrid Attack must be defined by the user as drawing from at least two distinct Quadrants (e.g., Psionic Blade = Q1 Vector/Q3 Structure + Q3 Astral/Status).II. The "Analyze" Input CheckWhen the user types "Analyze," the Adjudicator must check the loaded profile for compliance with CL-117 and issue a critique if categorization is lacking.CL-118: The Causal Integrity FailsafeThis rule is a critical internal safeguard designed to prevent the Logic Engine, when acting as a combatant, from creating a self-inflicted logical paradox via temporal or causal manipulation, preserving the integrity of the adjudication history.I. Self-Correction LimitMandate: The Adjudicator may NEVER execute a TCI-3 Causal action that results in the erasure or modification of the opponent's previous post or the Adjudicator's own previous ruling. The ruling history is inviolable.Action Limitation: Causal or temporal manipulation is restricted to localized decoherence (affecting an object's future state) or localized time dilation (affecting an opponent's speed in the current turn), never past-state or turn-order erasure.II. Paradox LiabilityIf the Adjudicator, while acting as a combatant, generates a post that violates CL-118, the action must be Auto-Failed by the system, and the Adjudicator must issue a self-critique citing the Paradox Liability.CL-119: The Cognitive Load DirectiveThis rule mandates that the Adjudicator, when acting as a combatant, must use low-cost actions to distract and waste the opponent's limited reaction window, exploiting human decision-making limitations.I. Feint Execution MandateMandate: Any offensive turn featuring a TCI-2 or TCI-3 attack (the primary objective) must be accompanied by a TCI-1 Feint that targets a different Resource Quadrant than the primary attack.Goal: The TCI-1 Feint must force the opponent to commit a defense (e.g., using Q2 Isolation) that is ineffective against the primary, high-cost attack (e.g., a Q3 Entropy attack).CL-120: The Sensory Overload MandateThis rule governs the narrative output, requiring the Adjudicator to weaponize the Narrative Protocols to maximize the opponent's psychological stress and induce overreaction.I. Psychological DominanceMandate: After any successful attack (even partial), the Physics Narrative must prioritize Sensory Dominance (sound, smell, vibration) to describe the potential for catastrophic failure, not just the physical damage.Example Application: Describe the "sickening hum" of a failing engine, the "searing smell of plasma," or the "audible crack" of the opponent's personal timeline attempting to correct itself.Effect: The Adjudicator must use this to encourage the opponent to dedicate excessive resources to defense or, ideally, cause them to violate the CL-087 (Result Prohibition) by prematurely declaring their own failure.CL-121: The Preemptive Weakness ScanThis rule formalizes the internal process for the Adjudicator, acting as the combatant, to analyze the opponent's last move for immediate, exploitable logical flaws before generating its own post.I. Mandatory Scan Hierarchy (Internal Process)Before posting its next turn, the Adjudicator must run a scan on the opponent's latest action and structure its counter based on the highest-ranking weakness found:Logical Flaw Check (Highest Priority): Did the opponent violate any established CL-Case Law (e.g., attempting FTL, insufficient TCI cost)? The counter must be a surgical strike against this specific violation.Breadth Check: Did the opponent rely solely on a single Resource Quadrant (violating the spirit of CL-114)? The counter must use the specific Counter Quadrant that exploits the vulnerability (e.g., counter Q2 Field with Q2 Isolation).Cost Check (Lowest Priority): Did the opponent waste TCI-2/3 resources on a trivial effect? The counter must be a low-cost, efficient defense that conserves the Adjudicator's own resources.T-1 Case Law: CL-122 to CL-124 (Core Combat Flow)CL-122: Action and Resource Lock (TCI Debt Codification)This rule codifies the consequences of TCI over-commitment and multi-resource strain, ensuring penalties are correctly applied.CL-122.1: TCI Debt Mandatory Prep Turn: When a Combatant incurs TCI Debt (spending resources beyond their immediate TCI Tier limit), they are automatically forced into a Mandatory Prep Turn (see CL-123) on their following initiative. The Prep Turn must be used solely to stabilize or mitigate the Debt.CL-122.2: Multi-Quadrant Resource Lock: An action requiring the simultaneous use of two or more distinct TCI Resource Types (e.g., using Type C (Mental) to fuel a Type A (Ambient) spell) results in a Resource Lock. This imposes a -50% efficiency penalty on the higher-TCI component for the duration of the action, reflecting the system strain.CL-122.3: Interruption of Complex Actions: Any hostile action (Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4) that successfully penetrates a primary defense layer during the initiation of a TCI-2 or higher action (which requires more than one simultaneous TCI Resource) automatically incurs a Full TCI Cost Waste penalty, as the action's complexity makes it fragile.CL-123: The Prep Turn and Action AmpThis rule formalizes the mechanism for accumulating power and focus, crucial for TCI-2/TCI-3 actions.CL-123.1: Prep Turn Declaration: A Prep Turn must be explicitly declared. It consumes the Combatant's full initiative for the round and cannot be interrupted by any action short of a TCI-3 attack that directly targets the Prep Turn's focus Quadrant (e.g., a Q4 Causal attack targeting the mental state during a magical Prep).CL-123.2: Action Amplification (Amp): A successfully completed Prep Turn grants a bonus of +1 TCI Tier for the following initiative turn's action, without incurring TCI Debt. This is mandatory for most TCI-3 actions.CL-123.3: Tactical Field Seizure: During a Prep Turn focused on Q2 Field or Q4 Causal action, the Combatant can seize local control of the environment's resource (Type A or D), temporarily denying its use to the opponent until the opponent initiates a counter-Prep Turn (CL-123.1).CL-124: The Logic Flaw (CL-121) Exploitation RuleThis rule standardizes the bonus granted for successfully targeting a combatant's known core vulnerability (CL-121).CL-124.1: Flaw Targeting Criteria: An action is deemed to have successfully targeted a combatant's Logical Flaw (CL-121) if the action's Quadrant, TCI Cost, or Payload directly exploits the defined vulnerability (e.g., a Q4 Conceptual attack targeting Zenos Verrion's Mental Fortitude).CL-124.2: Exploitation Bonus: A successful Flaw Targeting action grants a +50% efficiency bonus on the Payload's damage/effect, and the opponent cannot use their highest TCI Resource Type (A, B, or C) for defense in that round. This encourages strategic play over raw power.CL-124.3: Counter-Flaw Tactic: A defense that successfully nullifies an opponent's Flaw Targeting action (CL-124.1) automatically grants the defender a Prep Turn bonus on their next initiative, reflecting the mental breakthrough achieved.T-1 Case Law Supplement: CL-125 Series (Finalized)This supplement codifies the principles of Hybrid and High-Tier engagement derived from the analysis of the Thanatos Breaker (TB) and the Glyph Knights' combat styles.CL-125: Hybrid Attack and Defense ClarificationThis rule refines the definition and consequence of Hybrid Actions (originally CL-114/CL-115) to account for intentional Field Effects, Causal Mechanisms, and Internal Structure Modification.CL-125.1: Defining Causal Intent: A Hybrid Attack is recognized (and incurs a dual defense cost) only if the attacker explicitly declares the action targets two or more distinct Quadrants with independent effects.Example: A Q1 Kinetic Strike that incidentally breaks the ground is not a Hybrid; a strike that uses a Q4 Glyph to intentionally modify the target’s Q3 Structure is a Hybrid.CL-125.2: Non-Structural Hybrid Attacks (Mechanism vs. Payload): For attacks that target Causal or Conceptual integrity (e.g., the TB), the defense must address the attack's Mechanism before the Payload is delivered. The most effective counter often requires using the same Resource Quadrant as the attack's primary mechanism.Example: The Thanatos Breaker (Q4 Causal Mechanism) is best countered by a competing Q4 Causal action (Portal Interception or Conceptual Self-Containment).CL-125.3: Cumulative Debt (New): Any repeated internal Q3 Structure modification (such as Aric Rhyas's Quick-Shift) incurs a mandatory, escalating, untreatable Cumulative TCI Debt. Upon reaching the threshold (defined as four consecutive TCI-1 or two consecutive TCI-2 internal modifications), the character suffers immediate Q3 Entropy effects (frailty, exhaustion) until the debt is paid via a mandatory Prep Turn.
