Kin to the Unhallowed Sovereign, Dextrius, his brother. Sorcerer's title lay as it is, a title. The supreme overlord of all magics with the kingdom.Attire: A green hooded robe with gold stitching along the cuffs and the bottom hem of the robe. The hood lay patterned with a beast of six arms, and no face. His arms wrapped in leather hide manacles bearing a ruby in the left and a sapphire in the right for elemental purposes. About his neck hands a copper circle with thirty six lines passing at several angles. The A`læhean Portal of the Beast-God, Boracelas. Always embraced in his right hand is an oak staff with thousands of A`læhean scriptures etched into its core. A sealed stage of crystalline essence keeps the powers from releasing on their own, but not for the Sorcerers protection, but the enemy.______________________________________________________________________________PRIMARY MAGICS______________________________________________________________________________Quintessence of The Unhallowed Capitulation Plague:Animus Septicemia:Septicemia Nex:Darcellus Udioz - Soul destruction.A`læhean Elementalism______________________________________________________________________________Secondary Magic______________________________________________________________________________Unhallowed Dominion – Quintessence>Undead>Glowing eyes>Bad timeSanctum – Some sort of badly described barrier. Scourges - Scaling AoE attack>Energy field?>Profit. Decomposis – Turns undead soldiers into sources of energy, bombs, etc. Whatever.______________________________________________________________________________Confinement of Fate______________________________________________________________________________Impact Subitae – The Octagonal Box of Destruction. Eight pillars of serpents and the growling fog of wolves. The floor a resurrection post as the dead ascend and with the final release of Unhallowed Purgence. This forms a cubical of sorts cutting off any abilities or powers the opponent may possess and without the true strength to disray the final blow. The final step of 4 creates a haven controlled by the Sorcerer in which all his power and a quarter of his soul are released in one enormous display of radical power and destructive vengeance.Anguis Cista – (Serpent Box) The oak staff is whirled around as coils of blue rapidly slither from the action. The incantation is then spoken with a thunderous attitude. The staff can produce up to twelve of these beings. Their heads erupt from a reaction of crystalline influence from within Sorcerer. Viperous fangs and ranging from eight to ten feet. Their purpose is to reach eight different points of the battlefield and erect themselves forming an octagon.Luporum Nebula – (Wolves of Fog) The oak staff is positioned horizontally as the incantation is spoken. The left hand spreads the fingers wide as a vaporous mist of growls, snarls and howling rolls across the battlefield. Their abilities are able to bite at any position that incases the opponent.Inferni Futurus – (Dead Rising) The staff is slammed into the dirt as the incantation is spoken with the eyes rolled into the back of your head. A dark odorous smell will ascend from the soil as will the hands of thousands of souls from Hell. The disruption of their slumber is directed to the opponent.Cella Contritio – (Cell Destruction) The Unhallowed Purgence which is summoned by clasping both hands around the staff and vanquishing its existence allowing a rocketing force of energy to take to the skys and vaporize into the ground.______________________________________________________________________________Space and Time Continuum Foreclosure______________________________________________________________________________Aevus – Haults the extortion of forbidden magic to manipulate the altercation for personal gain. The Space and Time Continuum require a tribute to the mal tampering. The requirements being a sacrifice as an example. As a holder of the chained watch, it’s a free pass for the injustice caused by the opponent.Aevus** is not under my control at anytime. Decisions are thusly for the good of the past, present and future. Command of Fate and the Divine layout are all that bar him to any words or actions.Spiritual Resistance MagicSpiritus Liberatio E Magister (Soul Release from Master) - The left hand of the Sorcerer spreads the fingers and bends the tips into a clawing motion with a swipe with force; a radiating display of orbs cascade from the Earths soil and from the sky. The neutral powers wrap themselves into the enemy spirits rendering their control to nothing. The dissipation of the spirits doesn’t recon to another’s control but to simply become at peace and out of control ever again.Relinquite Apparitione ( Apparition of Relinquish) - The staff fabricates into a mirror encased with gold and silver etchings. The manifestation of Apparitions may attempt attack and may attempt to fuse their energies with the Sorcerers own but through the mirror they witness a void of cotangent nothingness where their essence will become nothingness. The mirror’s pull much like the ectoplasm distributor in owns own conjuring relinquishes the powers into a render less state. For precautions the mirror displays a white barrier behind it’s wielder.__________________________________________________________________________________WEAPONS______________________________________________________________________________Voralonus - An oak staff with thousands of A`læhean scriptures etched into its core. A sealed stage of crystalline essence keeps the powers from releasing on their own, but not for the Sorcerers protection, but the enemys. The staff is not the main source of power, but the chandler for more dire control of the releases.A`læhean Dagger - Inscriptions of the A`læhean Beast-God, Boracelas. The blade's primary purpose is to get a mere drop of the enemies blood and use the incantation of The Beast-God.Incantation: "I lend thy flesh, and the blood of the enemy. Lend us your protection, your wisdom and you ever enduring power. Rise thy lord and creator, Boracelus."A`laehean Chained Watch of Time – The pendulum of the watch activates with the incantation ‘Aevus Sisto’ as a rip in the dimensional fabrication opens like an eye behind the Sorcerer. From there an ancient clock called Aevus peers through the opening. It’s face resounding with eyes, as tendrils a mass from the inner chambers. It’s purpose is the gate keeper of manipulation of realm, time and space.______________________________________________________________________________RALEAHJIAN FOREST ARMY CREATION______________________________________________________________________________Seeds of Oak - Ancient seeds from the sacred tree's from the sub-realm beneath the thriving A`læh. The seeds from the Beast-Gods own gardens. From there the Beast-God creates his vast Wooden Army (Raleahjians). Their essence is of the crystalline essence from one power bestowed to each Sorcerer, Darcellus Udioz, the ultimate power of all A`læh. ** In order for the manifestation of the Wooden Soldiers, they require the liquid of the Beast-Gods saliva.Boracelus Saliva - The liquid saliva from the Beast-Gods own mouth. The core to the Raleahjian force.**You must give tribute to the Beast-God by sacrificing a daggers width, depth and length of your own flesh and use it to fertilize the Army's accelerated growth.
