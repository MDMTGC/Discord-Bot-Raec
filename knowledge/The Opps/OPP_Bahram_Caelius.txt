He prefers the solitude of his own life. His mind is an amalgam of thoughts brought through from various places - and it paints his actions with the broad strokes of an artist's brush. Preferring to follow a path set before him by his own intricate designs, he is often found in that same solitude. Untouched and undermined, he heralds his own might when deigning to become involved in the affairs of others. Bahram sees everything as beneath him, and in fact his own alignment with the Eternals is something of a mystery. They don't know where he comes from, or what he's even fully capable of - but they couldn't deny his worthiness nor his power. Mysterious in his own designs, the others know little to nothing about him.WeaponsNonePowersPsion: A formidable mind holding knowledge beyond the scope of many, his understanding of the world is so advanced that it becomes possible for his thoughts themselves to shape and warp the very nature of the world around him. Advanced psionics allow for the manipulation of reality, the reading of minds and the foreseeing of the future.Enhanced Traits: The very nature of his being forces upon him the strength and the power far and beyond what any normal person might be able to accomplish. His natural strength is intimidating for even the strongest of warriors. His speed rivals the fastest of creatures - and yet he does it all with the grace and fluidity of a river flowing along its banks.Cosmic Magic: As a being born from the heat of an exploding star, the very nature of Aethera's universe exists within his veins - and flows through him with such might that he can sense the very nature of the cosmos. Manipulating that allows for an infinite control over the universe in which he stands - and his impressive physical traits are thought to be a direct derivation of this magic.Lysanderian Aspect: As a variation of his creator, he is the same in most conceivable ways. As a manner of speaking, Lysanderian Aspects are the same as their creator. A version of the original, created to interact on different planes of existence. A superdimensional being works on all planes at once, but not through the same body. For futher information on capabilities, and understanding what Bahram is capable of, see LysanderHistoryNo one is really sure from where Bahram came. One day he wasn't there, and the next he was. The exact nature of his life, his energy, and the way he came to be within Aethera is beyond comprehension for most. Some have their ideas, but they're undoubtedly wrong - his lips never speak. While he communicates mind to mind, even through this medium has his history never been revealed to anyone.
