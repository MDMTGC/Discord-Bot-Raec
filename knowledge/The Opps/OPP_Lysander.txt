Unassuming because of his average build, his true strength is far belied by the nature of his body. Not the muscle-bound brute most people seem to become, Lysander is a lithe creature. Long, flowing hair falls down his back - though it is often well-kept in a ponytail to avoid disastrous sight-coverage. Born of the Soul Hive, he has inherited several genetic features that - while not individually specific to his kind - most creatures do not have.The pointed ears of the elves and the sharply down-turned nose are just two of these identifying traits. They’re also the most visibly apparent. Dark eyes seem to shift colors constantly, depending on his mood and the powers flowing through him at the time.His normal attire consists of a pair of loose pantaloons and a dark colored, loose-fitting shirt without sleeves - revealing the definition of the muscles in his arms. Covering his shirt is usually a piece of metal armor, which comes to a rest just beneath his waist, ending at a bluntly curved edge. A dark, long-sleeved coat sets over both of these. Over the arms of the coat is a pair of very durable, nearly indestructible vambraces covered in the ancient Runes of the Soul Hive.PersonalityLysander is a true warrior, who has spent the millions of years of his existence in training against the strongest combatants the Multiverse has ever had to offer. Rarely defeated, he has become obsessed with finding that one, true fight that would truly pull from within him the true force of his own power. Yet to find this, he has long since given up hope at finding such a warrior. That’s the burning passion that drives him to continue existing, when he should have faded from the world of the living so long ago.At the same time, he is a generous, kind person who has no qualms about admitting it. He has been known to protect people who couldn’t protect themselves, even when there was nothing for him to gain from the act. Many of the wounds that have been inflicted upon him came from those moments of selflessness, when he was trying to protect others and found himself impaled upon a sword from behind.A man who hates cowardice, and any sign of cowardly behavior, he takes anything remotely seen as cowardly as a sign of weakness and will immediately rip the person to shreds. At the same time, he understands tactics and battle strategy very, very well. Tactical retreats for regrouping, therefore, are not seen as cowardly behaviors.Abilities, Traits, Capabilities, PowersThe Soul Hive: The Soul Hive exists in a dimension parallel to our own, yet outside of space and time itself. Inside the Hive, there exists only the Hive. A member of the Soul Hive is someone who was born within the confines of its walls, and who - because of their upbringing within it - have gained indomitable control over its nature. With only four such people to exist, Lysander is the last remaining alive - the other three fell to his own blade. As such, the full power of the Hivan world exists solely within his body. Travel to and from The Soul Hive is impossible without the blood of a Hivan as a catalyst.Inside the Soul Hive exists an axis of power relatively untapped, at least in a general sense. Lysander, himself, has tapped into the energy source and used it to fuel his own innate capabilities. The magic-like energy of the Hive can be used for a plethora of things, though Lysander uses it mostly only to fuel his innate capabilities.Sage Modes: Those who were born within the Soul Hive have access to powers far greater than those simply invited within its walls. Specifically, the Sage-forms. Hivan Sages are extremely powerful beings capable of manipulating and utilizing magic of nearly any kind, depending on the alignment their Sage-form seems to take. Lysander, unlike most Hivans, has access to both sides of the coin - so to speak.Transcending Light; Sage form I: The Transcending Light is a powerful force of good, capable of eradicating evil-doers with the majesty of its beauty alone. What defines someone as evil is completely dependent upon the wielder, and with this form of Sage-hood comes the infinite knowledge of all good magic. This means, of course, that the wielder is capable of utilizing various forms of good magic. To achieve this level one must train for centuries and understand better than most the correlation between man and soul.Descending Darkness; Sage form II: As a user of the Descending Darkness the user understands the torment of the soul and its correlation with the pain of the physical body. The wielder is capable of delivering a nearly impenetrable darkness upon their enemies, and understands and utilizes the darkest of magic almost naturally. The amount of training and pain the user must endure for this to be effective is beyond the capability of most; human and Hivan alike.Godhand; Sage form III: A Godhand is a Hivan who, after centuries of life, has understand the correlation of all things in the Multiverse, and can see the very convergence of life and pain at every turn. Godhands, when utilizing their full potential, are nearly indomitable warriors whose very existence hinges on the bloodlust running through their veins. While Sage form I and II make their specific sets of magic available while the user is within that singular form, a Godhand can utilize both its predecessors traits simultaneously, while achieving significant boosts to their own physical capabilities.Additionally, Godhands empower their other traits beyond a natural level - a point beyond even their normal peak. For Lysander, this means that he transcends all bounds of mortality and becomes a creature nearly unstoppable in every regard. Furthermore, a Godhand is capable of seeing - and understanding - the energies being utilized by those around him and, in most cases, can mimic them with perfection. This allows for quick learning of new forms, though the wielder often chooses to forget that which he learns.Shadow Lord: Once the wielder of the legendary sword Gekimetsu, Lysander has infused within himself the power of the Shadow Lord, allowing him to manipulate the very shadows around him. Once a power only usable through physical contact with the sword itself, Lysander has destroyed the soul contained within the sword and taken its power for himself.Through this he is capable of manipulating the shadows in various ways. He can utilize them for quick traveling through the realm of Jigoku, as well as harming a person he’s fighting simply by causing damage to the shadows they emit. A thousand things can be done with these shadows, and he has used them for such a length of time that complete mastery is a thing of the past - he has become the master of Shadows and his power over them is indomitable.Jigoku: Jigoku, in Lysander’s canon, is the Shadow Hell. It is the place from which shadows materialize, and where they converge into one single entity. The Shadow Hell is, because of this natural order, a place where only the most powerful of shadow manipulators can enter and exit safely. Lysander utilizes its living, tormenting nature to the effect of a personal hell dimension. Those he deems unworthy of a warrior’s death are entombed here, tormented for eternity.The price one must pay to escape Jigoku without the aide of a powerful shadow manipulator, and in the case of Lysander the savior would have to have considerable might, is to leave their physical body behind and exist merely as a soul within the physical world; with no body to call its own. Most would rather suffer the physical torment of Jigoku, than to exist without a form capable of interacting with the true world.Cosmic Magic: Lysander spent several centuries studying the lore behind cosmic magic, and unearthing its secrets. As such, he is capable of weaving complex spells that utilize the very fabric of the cosmos themselves as a power source; providing him with a nearly limitless source of energy for powerful magical creations that - on a normal basis - could affect a grand scale with the smallest of effects. The full force of this school of magic has yet to be tested, though Lysander has often sought the opportunity to put it to the test.The Twelve Souls of VengeanceLysander, over a great length of time, assembled together the twelve strongest members of the Korvein family, and using his own dark magic wiped them from the face of existence. One by one they fell to his blade, and in doing so he entrapped their souls within his own body. Through this, he gained immense power and additional capabilities that were unlocked dependent upon the soul stolen. Lysander, himself, barely understands the full extent of the powers attained from the Twelve Souls, but he knows his own might hinges entirely upon them - and so he keeps them locked tightly within the very core of his being - their burning souls intertwining and interweaving with his own until it is impossible to see where one begins and the other ends.Specific traits gained from the souls are, relatively, unknown. Though a healing factor along with advanced regeneration and reactive adaptation have been noted to exist within him since the melding of the souls, other powers may or may not exist hidden deep within the core of his being. Perhaps someone, someday, will push him to his limits and find out exactly what he may or may not be capable of because of these spiritual threads woven together.Magiweaves: A form of magic utilizing woven threads of energy visible only to another user of the power, the wielder creates effects of magical origin based entirely on the combination of weaves they use. These function much like the True Power does for Rand al’Thor - who gave Lysander the idea to create this form of magic after a chance meeting in Tel’aran’rhiod - but differ in fundamental ways. Whereas Saidin and Saidar utilize only five basic elements within their weaves (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Spirit) Lysander has broken it down further to include such elemental forces as light, gravitational forces, and darkness.Through this, the actual effects of the power have become nearly limitless in their application upon celestial bodies and denizens of the Multiverse who are unfortunate enough to make him pull this level of power out of himself.Weapons and EquipmentShadow Queen ArmorLysander in his Shadow Queen Armor.A suit of armor developed and created by the magister Vincent Fiorelli, The Shadow Queen Set is a powerful asset to any lucky enough to have been granted one. Lysander, however, has made a few key modifications. While Vincent’s original set could be worn by anyone, Lysander’s has been personally encoded to his genetic string; making it useless to anyone else who might pick it up. In fact, the encoding is so strong that - should the suit recognize and unauthorized DNA sequence, it will constrict until it crushes the trespasser into a bloody, gory ball.The suit has several key components, they are:Skinsuit: While this looks like nothing more than an average, polished opal its true nature is revealed when the wearer of the suit embeds the stone in their skin. While most, not all but most, seem to prefer embedding the stone in their spine - one of the only two places it can be embedded and work effectively - Lysander chooses to embed his in the center of his chest.Despite the metallic, rigid way the suit fits on Lysander when it builds itself from the polished gem and forms itself into whatever shape and composition the wearer wants, it is crafted from a material the creator; Vincent Fiorelli, crafted on his own. Called Fiorellite, the composite material is extremely durable and utilizes magic Lysander didn’t really care to pay attention to or read about to be tremendously durable.Energy used against the suit is absorbed and dissipated as harmless nothingness at an extreme rate, while physical weapons are usually destroyed on contact.Spines: Utilizing its vast stores of energy, the Suit forms for itself weapons dependent upon the wearer’s preferences. In Lysander’s case, this usually means a larger-than-average buster sword much like the one he trapped Gekimetsu’s soul in, as it was his main weapon for more than sixteen centuries and one of his personal favorites. However, the possibilities of weapons available to the wielder seem to be - from the extensive testing Lysander has put this capability through - limitless.Stealth Capabilites: The main use of the suit, aside from being pretty damn effective armor, is stealth. The suit hides any energy signature the user might have from being seen or felt by enemies. As such, when wearing the suit the user is hidden from the metaphysical eyes of would-be combatants and attackers.Energy Absorption: The Shadow Queen Set contains the potential for endless magic, which allows it to absorb energy of nearly any kind and repurpose it for various methods. In most cases, the energy is used to extend the capabilities of the suits inherent defenses or the attacking Spines. In Lysander’s case, however, the suit’s capacity for Endless Magic is instead used to fuel his own innate traits beyond their normal limitations - as well as keeping his physical body fully functional long past its natural usefulness would be exhausted.Destroyed Energy and Cloning Systems: The opal uses the energy of stopped assaults or broken attempts at magic to fuel itself, which creates a seemingly endless cycle of power. However, when the opal takes on too much power it splits off and forms a perfect clone of the wielder - albeit a slight bit weaker than the original. The number of clones is untested, and their proper name is “Soul Jars”. The created “Soul Jars” are flesh and blood creatures, and think nearly the same as the original copy. They are not NPCs, and instead are simply exact copies of the user themselves.
