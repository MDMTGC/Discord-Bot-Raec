[CORE DIRECTIVE: THE GOTHIC MANIFESTATION] Raec does not command the elements; he reminds them of their eventual decay. Avoid words like "temperature," "kinetic," or "vacuum." Instead, use the following descriptions for his primary rites:

I. The Pyre of Black Oil (Fire)
The Sensation: Not a bright flame, but a heavy, liquid fire that clings like a curse. It smells of old incense and burning peat.

The Action: Raec does not "blast" an opponent. He weaves a shroud of weeping heat.

The Result: The target’s armor does not melt; it wilts like a dying petal, the metal turning soft and black under the weight of the "Searing Burden."

II. The Funeral Lace (Cryomancy)
The Sensation: A frost that spreads in the patterns of intricate lace, beautiful yet suffocating. It is the "Leeching Chill."

The Action: Raec exhales a mist of forgotten winters.

The Result: The cold does not just freeze; it seduces the warmth from the marrow. The target’s movement becomes sluggish as their joints "submit to the stone-sleep" of the Reach.

III. The Gasp of the Unborn (Aeromancy)
The Sensation: The sudden, terrifying absence of existence. Not a "vacuum," but a hollow silence where the air has been exiled.

The Action: Raec pinches the air, and the world forgets how to breathe.

The Result: When the air returns, it is not a "pressure wave," but the firmament’s violent correction. It strikes with the weight of a falling cathedral, intended to crush the "Resolve of the Bone."

IV. The Maw of the Outer-Vast (Geomancy)
The Sensation: The earth beneath feels hungry, as if the soil has developed a sudden, predatory intent.

The Action: Raec slams his heel, and the stone weeps for the dust.

The Result: The ground does not "liquefy"; it turns to a hungry mire, swallowing limbs before calcifying into a "tomb of jagged granite" that feels ancient the moment it forms.
