DEFINITION: Planar Matter is not merely "solid energy"; it is matter subjected to exotic dimensional forces. It is categorized by its interaction with the Higgs Field (Mass) and Spacetime (Gravity).CLASS A: WOVEN MATTER (Constructs)Origin: Compressed Quintessence (Energy -> Structure).Physics Profile: High Inertia / Zero Gravity.Mechanic: It does not curve spacetime (Weightless), but it resists acceleration (Inertia).Combat Logic: Strikes deliver kinetic energy ($KE=1/2mv^2$) derived from the simulated density of the weave.The Hard Counter: Because it is a "Weave," it has a resonant frequency. It is highly vulnerable to Spell-Shatter and Destructive Interference. Disruption causes explosive decoherence ("Spell-Shrapnel").CLASS B: TRANSMUTED MATTER (Altered Baryonic)Origin: Standard matter exposed to planar extremes (e.g., Super-Gravity, Hyperspace).Physics Profile: Variable Inertia / Variable Gravity.Mechanic: It retains the physics of its origin plane.Hyper-Dense (Gravity Plane): Infinite density. Indestructible to physical force, but creates massive gravity wells.Spatial-Locked (Hyperspace): Resists movement relative to the cosmos. "Immovable Object" armor.The Hard Counter: Cannot be "Dispelled" (it is atomic). Must be countered by physics (e.g., Extreme Cold, Isolation).CLASS C: ANOMALY MATTER (Abstracts)Origin: Conceptual Realms (Dreams, Far Realm).Physics Profile: Non-Causal.Mechanic: Violates causality or biology. (e.g., Temporal Glass shatters 3 seconds after impact; Neuronic Gold conducts thought).Combat Logic: Interaction is a Hazard.
