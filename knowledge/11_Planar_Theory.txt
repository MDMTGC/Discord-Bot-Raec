A Comprehensive Guide to Cosmology, Matter, and MetaphysicsI. COSMOLOGY: THE STRUCTURE OF EXISTENCEThe Omniverse consists of a finite number of planes which together compose all matter, energy, and phenomena. These planes are separated by a Planar Boundary (a macrocosmic force maintaining distinction).Planar Stratification: Planes are not physically distant; they are superimposed. A single entity exists simultaneously across multiple planes: Body (Physical), Consciousness (Mental), Spirit (Spiritual), and Soul (Astral).The Seven Principal Planes (In Order of Potency)Figure 1: Conceptual visualization of the principal planes. Note that while distinct, they layer over one another.Physical Plane (Material Realm):Jurisdiction: Physics, Light, Heat, Kinetics, Matter.Nature: The "Neutral Ground" where all energies can coexist.Magical Plane (The Weave):Jurisdiction: Mana, Spellcraft, Summoning.Nature: Non-physical space used for teleportation and conjuration.Spiritual Plane (Ethereal/Celestial):Jurisdiction: Faith, Belief, Deities.Nature: Manifested belief. If enough beings believe in a god, it exists here.Mental Plane (Dream/Astral):*Jurisdiction: Thought, Psionics, Dreams.Nature: Subjective reality. Telepaths and Psions operate here.(Note: Often confused with the "Astral Plane," but distinct in function).Natural Plane (Life):Jurisdiction: Life Force, Fertility, Nature.Nature: "The Trump Card." Life energy is denser than thought. A planet is a massive reservoir of this energy.Astral Plane (The Void/Soul):Jurisdiction: Existence, Souls, Chi/Ki.Nature: The plane of Being. To kill a soul (True Death), one must target this plane.Cosmic Plane (Universal):Jurisdiction: Celestial Bodies, Entropy, Universal Phenomena.Nature: The nuclear option. Potent beyond comprehension, housed in stars.II. THE ENERGY HIERARCHY (POWER SCALING)Energy follows the Inverse Law of Complexity. As you descend the list (from Physical to Cosmic), energy becomes More Potent but Less Versatile.Versatility (Magical Energy): You can shape Mana into a thousand different spells (Fire, Ice, Shield, Light) because it is simple and malleable.Potency (Cosmic Energy): You cannot shape Cosmic energy easily. It is raw power. A single particle of Cosmic energy overwhelms a high volume of Magical energy.Combat Logic:Clash Rule: Higher-tier energy naturally disrupts lower-tier energy. A Psionic Blast (Tier 4) has a density advantage over a Magical Shield (Tier 2).Reinforcement: Chi/Ki (Tier 6) reinforces the physical body more effectively than Faith (Tier 3).III. PLANAR MATTER PHYSICSMatter is Energy given Structure. By densely weaving energy, one can create physical objects.The Inertia ParadoxPlanar Matter is not under the jurisdiction of standard physics regarding Gravity or Radiation, but it is subject to Inertia.Effect: It feels weightless (Zero Gravity) but hits with the force of a dense solid (High Inertia).Vulnerability: Because it is a "Weave," it has a resonant frequency. It is vulnerable to Spell-Shatter (Destructive Interference).Taxonomy of Exotic MatterImage of crystal lattice structureFigure 2: Representation of Class A "Woven" matter. The lattice structure creates solidity from energy.Class A: Woven Matter (Constructs):Origin: Compressed Quintessence/Mana.Properties: Weightless, High Inertia, Immune to Heat.Example: Hard-light bridges, Summoned Weapons.Class B: Transmuted Matter (Altered Baryonic):Origin: Standard matter exposed to planar extremes (e.g., Hyperspace, Super-Gravity).Properties: Retains the physics of the origin plane (e.g., Infinite Density, Spatial Locking).Note: Cannot be "Dispelled" (Atomic).Class C: Anomaly Matter (Abstracts):Origin: Conceptual Realms (Dreams, Far Realm).Properties: Violates causality or biology (e.g., Temporal Glass, Neuronic Gold).IV. PLANAR MECHANICS (INTERACTION)1. Planar Anchoring (The Lockdown)Definition: Weaving elements into a chain that binds the target's Essence to the current plane.Effect: Prevents Planar Walking/Teleportation.True Death: If a target dies while Anchored, their soul cannot return to a greater being or afterlife. It is trapped.2. Planar Walking (Travel)Definition: Using transitional points (cracks, portals) to ascend to a different plane.The Time Gap: Travel is not instantaneous. It requires finding a gap or "knocking on the door".Combat Logic: Attempting to Planar Walk creates an Attack Window during the ascension phase.SYSTEM REGISTRATION (For AI/Gem Use)When adjudicating Planar Logic, apply these constraints:Priority 1: Enforce the Energy Hierarchy. (Cosmic > Astral > Natural > Mental > Spiritual > Magical > Physical). Priority 2: Enforce Inertia on Planar Matter. It is not "illusionary"; it has kinetic mass. Priority 3: Enforce Time Gaps on Travel. No instant blinking. Priority 4: Specific Overrides: Life (Natural) overrides Thought (Mental). Existence (Astral) overrides Faith (Spiritual).
